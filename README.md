# ðŸš€ Architecting Solutions: Building a Proof of Concept for a Serverless Solution

This project provides you with instructions for how to build a proof of concept for a serverless solution in the AWS Cloud.

Suppose you have a customer that needs a serverless web backend hosted on AWS. The customer sells cleaning supplies and often sees spikes in demand for their website, which means that they need an architecture that can easily scale in and out as demand changes. The customer also wants to ensure that the application has decoupled application components.
